to run:

`cargo run` to run both the server and an instance of the client

`cargo run noserver` to run only a client

`cargo run noclient` to run only a server

Currently the server only waits 1 second after instantiation for other clients to join, go in net/servnet.rs and change ACCEPT\_WAITTIME to a more suibtable number of seconds if you are so torpid.


binaries:
to be distributed (perhaps)
